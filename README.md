# Capstone-3

Here's a summary of your capstone project proposal:

**Dataset:**

You are using a CSV file from Kaggle, which contains data from direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The dataset includes features related to bank client data (such as age, job, marital status) and social/economic context (such as employment variation rate, consumer price index).

**Research Questions:**

The project aims to predict which clients will subscribe to a term deposit.
It also seeks to identify the most important features for making this prediction.


**Hypotheses:**

The average age of customers without a term deposit is lower than that of customers with a term deposit.
The number of contacts during the campaign has no impact on whether a client subscribes to a term deposit.

**Methodology:**

You plan to use scatterplots and the Pearson correlation coefficient to check correlations.
An independent samples t-test will be used to examine differences in average scores.


**Target Audience:**

Companies looking to improve strategies for increasing term deposit subscriptions would find your findings valuable.
